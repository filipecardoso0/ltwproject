## Final Comments

Unfortunately we weren't able to add features like cart/order checkout & order managment, as well as search and 
image editing on (dishes, users and restaurants). <br>
However, I would say arround 90% of the project uses AJAX on data exchange/submission.
Also, the shopping cart uses localstorage to store the customer dishes, so even if the user is not registered, or closed the browser
as long has his browser stores the information he will be able to "proceed to checkout" (between quotes once it wasn't implemented unfortunately)
